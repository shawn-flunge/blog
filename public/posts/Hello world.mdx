import Highlight from '../src/components/Highlight';
import FlutterWidget from '../src/components/FlutterWidget';




사실 블로그에 글을 써야지 생각은 계속 가지고 있었고 실제로 노션에 언제든 포스트로 작성할 수 있게 정리해논 페이지가 꽤나 있었지만 일 핑계, 공부 핑계로 미루고 있었습니다.
그러다 Flutter 3.7버전이 발표되며 플러터 앱의 네이티브 웹 임베드가 가능해지고 마지막으로 최근 회사에서 웹 프로젝트를 얼떨결에 맡게돼 모든 조건들이 한곳을 가리키게 되었습니다.



<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.


## How

Simplify create multiple folders inside the main `/data/blog` folder and add your `.md`/`.mdx` files to them. You can even create something like `/data/blog/nested-route/deeply-nested-route/my-post.md`

We use Next.js catch all routes to handle the routing and path creations.

## Use Cases

Here are some reasons to use nested routes

- More logical content organisation (blogs will still be displayed based on the created date)
- Multi-part posts
- Different sub-routes for each author
- Internationalization (though it would be recommended to use [Next.js built-in i8n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing))

```js {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

<FlutterWidget dirName='HelloNext' height={120}/>

```jsx title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo2222' })
  }
}
```

- The previous/next post links at bottom of the template are currently sorted by date. One could explore modifying the template to refer the reader to the previous/next post in the series, rather than by date.
